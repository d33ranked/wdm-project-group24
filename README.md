## How To Run

### Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (test runner only)

### Start

```bash
# 2PC mode (default)
docker compose up -d --build

# SAGA mode
TRANSACTION_MODE=SAGA NGINX_CONF=gateway_nginx_saga.conf docker compose up -d --build
```

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Configuration

Pass as environment variables before `docker compose up`, or write to a `.env` file at the project root.


| Variable                | Default              | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRANSACTION_MODE`      | `TPC`                | Protocol to use. `TPC` for two-phase commit, `SAGA` for event-driven compensation.                       |
| `NGINX_CONF`            | `gateway_nginx.conf` | Nginx routing config. Must be `gateway_nginx_saga.conf` when `TRANSACTION_MODE=SAGA`.                    |
| `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `6000`               | Connection pool size per Redis pool per service worker. Tune to expected peak concurrency.               |
| `STREAM_BATCH_SIZE`     | `500`                | Messages fetched per `XREADGROUP` call. All messages in a batch are processed concurrently via `gevent`. |


Example `.env` for a smaller local machine:

```env
REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1200
STREAM_BATCH_SIZE=100
```

## The Orchestrator

Both protocols are driven by a single generic workflow engine in `common/orchestrator.py`. It knows nothing about orders or payments — it only knows how to run a list of Python functions in order, write its position to Redis before each step, and run them in reverse if something goes wrong.

**Write before you run.** Before executing step N, the engine writes "currently at step N" to Redis. If the process crashes mid-step, the position is already on disk. On restart, it reads the position and re-runs from there. Steps are idempotent, so re-running is always safe.

**Steps and compensations.** A workflow is a list of forward steps and a matching list of undo steps. If a forward step fails, the engine runs the compensations in reverse — undoing only the steps that already succeeded.

**Sync vs. Async.** In 2PC mode all steps run synchronously — the engine sends a message, waits for the reply, and moves on. In SAGA mode each step publishes a message and calls `suspend()`, pausing the engine until a background consumer calls `resume()` (success) or `fail()` (failure) when the reply arrives. Compensation steps in SAGA mode work the same way.

**Recovery.** On every startup the engine scans Redis for workflow instances that never reached `completed` or `failed`, reads their stored position, and continues from exactly where they stopped.

## Test Suite

The test suite lives in `test/`. It is a standalone CLI — no external test framework. It builds the stack, runs all cases in order, and prints a pass/fail report.

### Run

```bash
cd test
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

python run.py                                    # 2PC mode, full build and fresh stack
python run.py --mode SAGA                        # SAGA mode
python run.py --skip-build                       # skip docker compose build
python run.py --no-restart                       # reuse an already-running stack
BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8000 python run.py  # custom gateway address
```

### Suite Order

1. Common — mode-agnostic correctness and durability
2. 2PC or SAGA — protocol-specific correctness (selected by `--mode`)
3. Replication — Sentinel failover and data durability (always runs last; it changes cluster topology)

## Test Cases

### Common Suite


| Test                                   | What It Verifies                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Item Checkout**                | A checkout with multiple distinct items deducts the correct quantity from each and charges the exact total.      |
| **Double Checkout**                    | A second checkout on an already-paid order is a no-op — no duplicate charge, no extra stock deduction.           |
| **Post-Checkout Tampering**            | Adding items to a paid order and retrying checkout produces no extra charge and no stock change.                 |
| **Empty Order Checkout**               | Checking out an order with no items returns 200 without crashing anything.                                       |
| **10 Concurrent Checkouts For 1 Unit** | Ten users race for the last unit; exactly one succeeds and stock never goes negative.                            |
| **Sequential Drain**                   | Sequential checkouts exhaust stock in order; the request that would exceed available stock is rejected cleanly.  |
| **5 Independent Parallel Checkouts**   | Five isolated concurrent checkouts each succeed without interfering with each other.                             |
| **External Stock Change**              | Reducing stock between order creation and checkout causes the checkout to fail correctly.                        |
| **Fund User After Order**              | Adding sufficient credit after order creation but before checkout allows the checkout to succeed.                |
| **Balance Exactly Equals Total**       | Checkout succeeds when credit equals the order cost exactly — not one unit to spare.                             |
| **Stock Exactly Equals Quantity**      | Checkout succeeds when available stock equals the ordered quantity exactly.                                      |
| **One Credit Short**                   | Checkout is rejected when the user is exactly one credit unit short.                                             |
| **One Stock Unit Short**               | Checkout is rejected when stock is exactly one unit below the ordered quantity.                                  |
| **Non-Existent Resource Lookup**       | GET requests for unknown IDs return 4xx, not 5xx.                                                                |
| **addItem Idempotency**                | The same add-item request sent twice with the same idempotency key applies the change only once.                 |
| **Partial Stock Failure**              | If any item in a multi-item batch is out of stock, the entire checkout fails atomically — no partial deductions. |
| **Batch Init**                         | `batch_init` creates integer-keyed items and users that are immediately readable via the API.                    |
| **Add-Stock Idempotency**              | Duplicate add-stock requests with the same idempotency key do not double the stock.                              |
| **Pay Idempotency**                    | Duplicate add-funds requests with the same idempotency key do not double the credit.                             |
| **Order Item Merge**                   | Adding the same item to an order twice merges quantities into a single line item.                                |
| **Zero/Negative Amount Rejected**      | `add_stock` and `add_funds` reject amounts ≤ 0 with a 4xx response.                                              |
| **Item Not Found Subtract**            | Subtracting stock from a non-existent item returns 4xx, not 5xx.                                                 |
| **User Not Found Pay**                 | Charging a non-existent user returns 4xx, not 5xx.                                                               |
| **Malformed Stream Message**           | A garbage message injected into the stream does not crash consumers; the next valid request still succeeds.      |
| **Payment Redis AOF Durability**       | Credit written to Redis survives a container restart; checkout succeeds after the restart.                       |
| **Stock Redis AOF Durability**         | Stock written to Redis survives a container restart; checkout succeeds after the restart.                        |
| **Concurrent Oversell Prevention**     | 20 users racing to buy 3 units result in exactly 3 successful checkouts and exactly 3 charges — no oversell.     |
| **Stock Service Crash Mid-Batch**      | Killing and restarting the stock service during a concurrent batch produces no oversell and no phantom charges.  |
| **Redis Bus Restart Recovery**         | Restarting the shared message bus does not prevent subsequent checkouts from completing.                         |


### 2PC Suite


| Test                           | What It Verifies                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PREPARE → COMMIT**           | PREPARE holds the reservation and reduces visible stock/credit; COMMIT makes the deduction permanent.                |
| **PREPARE → ABORT**            | PREPARE holds the reservation; ABORT returns all reserved resources to their original values.                        |
| **Vote NO**                    | PREPARE for more than available is rejected with 4xx; no reservation is made and nothing changes.                    |
| **PREPARE Locks Resources**    | A PREPARE-held reservation is unavailable to concurrent regular subtract operations.                                 |
| **ABORT Releases Resources**   | After ABORT, the previously locked resources are available for new operations.                                       |
| **Competing PREPAREs**         | Two concurrent PREPAREs on the same insufficient stock — the first wins, the second votes NO.                        |
| **Idempotent COMMIT**          | Calling COMMIT twice on the same transaction produces no double deduction.                                           |
| **ABORT Safety**               | ABORT on a non-existent or already-committed transaction returns 200 and changes nothing.                            |
| **Stock Votes NO**             | When stock cannot fulfil, the coordinator aborts the entire checkout — payment is untouched.                         |
| **Payment Votes NO**           | When payment cannot fulfil, the coordinator aborts and fully reverses the stock reservation.                         |
| **Participant Crash Recovery** | Stock service killed mid-checkout restarts and the coordinator successfully retries the operation.                   |
| **Coordinator Crash Recovery** | A stuck in-doubt workflow injected directly into the log is deterministically resolved by `recovery_tpc` on restart. |


### SAGA Suite


| Test                                 | What It Verifies                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compensating Transaction**         | Stock is reserved, then payment fails; the saga fires a compensating transaction that fully restores stock.               |
| **Stock Fails, No Payment**          | Immediate stock failure causes early rejection — the payment step is never attempted.                                     |
| **Participant Crash Recovery**       | Stock service killed mid-saga; the stream's pending re-delivery mechanism completes the saga after restart.               |
| **Coordinator Crash Recovery**       | A stuck workflow injected into the log is consistently resolved (committed or compensated) by `recovery_saga` on restart. |
| **Double-Checkout Prevention**       | A second checkout on an already-paid order is detected and skipped; stock and credit are unchanged.                       |
| **Multi-Item Compensation**          | All items from a failed multi-item checkout are fully restored by the compensating transaction — no partial rollback.     |
| **Concurrent Correlation Isolation** | 20 simultaneous checkouts each receive the correct, isolated response via their correlation ID.                           |
| **Pending-Message Re-Delivery**      | A stream message left unACKed due to a crash is re-delivered and processed correctly after restart.                       |


### Replication Suite


| Test                                    | What It Verifies                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payment Primary SIGKILL**             | Data written before a hard kill of the payment primary survives on the promoted replica; checkouts continue through the new master.   |
| **Coordinator DB SIGKILL Mid-Checkout** | Killing the order-service's Redis mid-checkout and restarting order-service resolves the transaction consistently with no data loss.  |
| **Bus Primary SIGKILL With In-Flight**  | Killing the message bus during 10 concurrent checkouts results in no phantom charges or oversell after Sentinel promotes the replica. |
| **One Sentinel Down**                   | Killing one of three sentinels still leaves quorum intact; a subsequent primary failure is correctly failed over.                     |
| **50 Writes Before Primary SIGKILL**    | All 50 items written to a primary before a hard kill are readable from the promoted replica — zero data loss on promotion.            |
