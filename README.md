## How To Run

### Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+

### Start

```bash
python start.py
```

The Launcher Asks Five Short Questions and Handles Everything Else.


| Prompt                             | Options                   | What It Does                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mode?**                          | TPC / SAGA                | Selects the Transaction Protocol                                              |
| **Action?**                        | Start Stack / Run Tests   | Starts the System, or Builds and Runs the Full Benchmark                      |
| **Replicas?**                      | Compose Defaults / Custom | Defaults: 1 Gateway, 2 of Each Service. Custom Lets You Set Each Individually |
| **Pool And Stream Batch?**         | Project Defaults / Custom | Tunes the Redis Connection Pool Size and Stream Batch Size                    |
| **Skip Build?** *(Run Tests Only)* | Yes / No                  | Skips `docker compose build` if Images Are Already Up to Date                 |


After the Benchmark Finishes the Stack Is Torn Down Automatically.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Configuration

`start.py` Sets All Variables Interactively. For Headless or CI Runs, Export Them as Environment Variables or Place a `.env` File at the Project Root — Docker Compose Picks It Up Automatically.


| Variable                | Default                   | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRANSACTION_MODE`      | `SAGA`                    | Protocol to Use. `TPC` for Two-Phase Commit, `SAGA` for Event-Driven Compensation.                       |
| `NGINX_CONF`            | `gateway_nginx_saga.conf` | Nginx Config File. Must Match the Selected `TRANSACTION_MODE`.                                           |
| `GATEWAY_REPLICAS`      | `1`                       | Number of API Gateway Containers.                                                                        |
| `ORDER_REPLICAS`        | `2`                       | Number of Order Service Containers.                                                                      |
| `STOCK_REPLICAS`        | `2`                       | Number of Stock Service Containers.                                                                      |
| `PAYMENT_REPLICAS`      | `2`                       | Number of Payment Service Containers.                                                                    |
| `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `6000`                    | Connection Pool Size Per Redis Pool Per Service Worker.                                                  |
| `STREAM_BATCH_SIZE`     | `500`                     | Messages Fetched Per `XREADGROUP` Call. All Messages in a Batch Are Processed Concurrently via `gevent`. |
| `DDM_SKIP_BUILD`        | *(unset)*                 | Set to `1` to Skip `docker compose build` When Running the Test Suite Headlessly.                        |
| `DDM_NO_RESTART`        | *(unset)*                 | Set to `1` to Skip `docker compose down/up` and Reuse the Running Stack.                                 |


## The Orchestrator

Both Protocols Are Driven by a Single Generic Workflow Engine in `common/orchestrator.py`. It Knows Nothing About Orders or Payments — It Only Knows How to Run a List of Python Functions in Order, Write Its Position to Redis Before Each Step, and Run Them in Reverse If Something Goes Wrong.

**Write Before You Run.** Before Executing Step N, the Engine Writes "Currently at Step N" to Redis. If the Process Crashes Mid-Step, the Position Is Already on Disk. On Restart, It Reads the Position and Re-Runs From There. Steps Are Idempotent, so Re-Running Is Always Safe.

**Steps and Compensations.** A Workflow Is a List of Forward Steps and a Matching List of Undo Steps. If a Forward Step Fails, the Engine Runs the Compensations in Reverse — Undoing Only the Steps That Already Succeeded.

**Sync vs. Async.** In TPC Mode All Steps Run Synchronously — the Engine Sends a Message, Waits for the Reply, and Moves On. In SAGA Mode Each Step Publishes a Message and Calls `suspend()`, Pausing the Engine Until a Background Consumer Calls `resume()` (Success) or `fail()` (Failure) When the Reply Arrives. Compensation Steps in SAGA Mode Work the Same Way.

**Recovery.** On Every Startup the Engine Scans Redis for Workflow Instances That Never Reached `completed` or `failed`, Reads Their Stored Position, and Continues From Exactly Where They Stopped.

## Test Suite

The Test Suite Lives in `test/`. It Is a Standalone CLI — No External Test Framework. It Builds the Stack, Runs All Cases in Order, and Prints a Pass/Fail Report.

### Run

Run via `python start.py` → Select **Run Tests**. The Launcher Builds the Stack, Runs All Suites in Order, and Tears Everything Down When Finished.

Install the Python Dependencies Beforehand If You Haven't Already:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suite Order

1. Common — Mode-Agnostic Correctness and Durability
2. TPC or SAGA — Protocol-Specific Correctness (Driven by `TRANSACTION_MODE`)
3. Replication — Sentinel Failover and Data Durability (Always Runs Last; It Changes Cluster Topology)

## Test Cases

### Common Suite


| Test                                   | What It Verifies                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Item Checkout**                | A checkout with multiple distinct items deducts the correct quantity from each and charges the exact total.      |
| **Double Checkout**                    | A second checkout on an already-paid order is a no-op — no duplicate charge, no extra stock deduction.           |
| **Post-Checkout Tampering**            | Adding items to a paid order and retrying checkout produces no extra charge and no stock change.                 |
| **Empty Order Checkout**               | Checking out an order with no items returns 200 without crashing anything.                                       |
| **10 Concurrent Checkouts For 1 Unit** | Ten users race for the last unit; exactly one succeeds and stock never goes negative.                            |
| **Sequential Drain**                   | Sequential checkouts exhaust stock in order; the request that would exceed available stock is rejected cleanly.  |
| **5 Independent Parallel Checkouts**   | Five isolated concurrent checkouts each succeed without interfering with each other.                             |
| **External Stock Change**              | Reducing stock between order creation and checkout causes the checkout to fail correctly.                        |
| **Fund User After Order**              | Adding sufficient credit after order creation but before checkout allows the checkout to succeed.                |
| **Balance Exactly Equals Total**       | Checkout succeeds when credit equals the order cost exactly — not one unit to spare.                             |
| **Stock Exactly Equals Quantity**      | Checkout succeeds when available stock equals the ordered quantity exactly.                                      |
| **One Credit Short**                   | Checkout is rejected when the user is exactly one credit unit short.                                             |
| **One Stock Unit Short**               | Checkout is rejected when stock is exactly one unit below the ordered quantity.                                  |
| **Non-Existent Resource Lookup**       | GET requests for unknown IDs return 4xx, not 5xx.                                                                |
| **addItem Idempotency**                | The same add-item request sent twice with the same idempotency key applies the change only once.                 |
| **Partial Stock Failure**              | If any item in a multi-item batch is out of stock, the entire checkout fails atomically — no partial deductions. |
| **Batch Init**                         | `batch_init` creates integer-keyed items and users that are immediately readable via the API.                    |
| **Add-Stock Idempotency**              | Duplicate add-stock requests with the same idempotency key do not double the stock.                              |
| **Pay Idempotency**                    | Duplicate add-funds requests with the same idempotency key do not double the credit.                             |
| **Order Item Merge**                   | Adding the same item to an order twice merges quantities into a single line item.                                |
| **Zero/Negative Amount Rejected**      | `add_stock` and `add_funds` reject amounts ≤ 0 with a 4xx response.                                              |
| **Item Not Found Subtract**            | Subtracting stock from a non-existent item returns 4xx, not 5xx.                                                 |
| **User Not Found Pay**                 | Charging a non-existent user returns 4xx, not 5xx.                                                               |
| **Malformed Stream Message**           | A garbage message injected into the stream does not crash consumers; the next valid request still succeeds.      |
| **Payment Redis AOF Durability**       | Credit written to Redis survives a container restart; checkout succeeds after the restart.                       |
| **Stock Redis AOF Durability**         | Stock written to Redis survives a container restart; checkout succeeds after the restart.                        |
| **Concurrent Oversell Prevention**     | 20 users racing to buy 3 units result in exactly 3 successful checkouts and exactly 3 charges — no oversell.     |
| **Stock Service Crash Mid-Batch**      | Killing and restarting the stock service during a concurrent batch produces no oversell and no phantom charges.  |
| **Redis Bus Restart Recovery**         | Restarting the shared message bus does not prevent subsequent checkouts from completing.                         |


### TPC Suite


| Test                           | What It Verifies                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PREPARE → COMMIT**           | PREPARE holds the reservation and reduces visible stock/credit; COMMIT makes the deduction permanent.                |
| **PREPARE → ABORT**            | PREPARE holds the reservation; ABORT returns all reserved resources to their original values.                        |
| **Vote NO**                    | PREPARE for more than available is rejected with 4xx; no reservation is made and nothing changes.                    |
| **PREPARE Locks Resources**    | A PREPARE-held reservation is unavailable to concurrent regular subtract operations.                                 |
| **ABORT Releases Resources**   | After ABORT, the previously locked resources are available for new operations.                                       |
| **Competing PREPAREs**         | Two concurrent PREPAREs on the same insufficient stock — the first wins, the second votes NO.                        |
| **Idempotent COMMIT**          | Calling COMMIT twice on the same transaction produces no double deduction.                                           |
| **ABORT Safety**               | ABORT on a non-existent or already-committed transaction returns 200 and changes nothing.                            |
| **Stock Votes NO**             | When stock cannot fulfil, the coordinator aborts the entire checkout — payment is untouched.                         |
| **Payment Votes NO**           | When payment cannot fulfil, the coordinator aborts and fully reverses the stock reservation.                         |
| **Participant Crash Recovery** | Stock service killed mid-checkout restarts and the coordinator successfully retries the operation.                   |
| **Coordinator Crash Recovery** | A stuck in-doubt workflow injected directly into the log is deterministically resolved by `recovery_tpc` on restart. |


### SAGA Suite


| Test                                 | What It Verifies                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compensating Transaction**         | Stock is reserved, then payment fails; the saga fires a compensating transaction that fully restores stock.               |
| **Stock Fails, No Payment**          | Immediate stock failure causes early rejection — the payment step is never attempted.                                     |
| **Participant Crash Recovery**       | Stock service killed mid-saga; the stream's pending re-delivery mechanism completes the saga after restart.               |
| **Coordinator Crash Recovery**       | A stuck workflow injected into the log is consistently resolved (committed or compensated) by `recovery_saga` on restart. |
| **Double-Checkout Prevention**       | A second checkout on an already-paid order is detected and skipped; stock and credit are unchanged.                       |
| **Multi-Item Compensation**          | All items from a failed multi-item checkout are fully restored by the compensating transaction — no partial rollback.     |
| **Concurrent Correlation Isolation** | 20 simultaneous checkouts each receive the correct, isolated response via their correlation ID.                           |
| **Pending-Message Re-Delivery**      | A stream message left unACKed due to a crash is re-delivered and processed correctly after restart.                       |


### Replication Suite


| Test                                         | What It Verifies                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payment Primary SIGKILL**                  | Data written before a hard kill of the payment primary survives on the promoted replica; checkouts continue through the new master.   |
| **Coordinator DB SIGKILL Mid-Checkout**      | Killing the order-service's Redis mid-checkout and restarting order-service resolves the transaction consistently with no data loss.  |
| **Bus Primary SIGKILL With In-Flight**       | Killing the message bus during 10 concurrent checkouts results in no phantom charges or oversell after Sentinel promotes the replica. |
| **One Sentinel Down**                        | Killing one of three sentinels still leaves quorum intact; a subsequent primary failure is correctly failed over.                     |
| **50 Writes Before Primary SIGKILL**         | All 50 items written to a primary before a hard kill are readable from the promoted replica — zero data loss on promotion.            |
| **Service Scale-Out Correctness**            | Scaling stock-service to three replicas does not corrupt data; a full checkout deducts stock and credit exactly once.                 |
| **Replica Killed, System Continues**         | Killing one of three order-service replicas does not interrupt the system; the remaining two handle new checkouts without errors.     |
| **Concurrent Correctness Under Replication** | Ten concurrent checkouts with all services at three replicas produce no oversell and no phantom charges.                              |
