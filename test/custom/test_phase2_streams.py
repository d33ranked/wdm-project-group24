"""
Phase 2 — Redis Streams Tests
==============================
SAGA-mode-only tests that specifically exercise behaviours introduced by
the Kafka → Redis Streams migration.

What these tests validate
--------------------------
1. Double-checkout prevention — a second checkout on an in-flight or already-
   completed order is rejected cleanly; the stream consumer handles the
   duplicate without corrupting state.

2. Multi-item compensation — when payment fails after stock has already been
   reserved for several items, the compensating transaction restores ALL items,
   not just the first one.

3. Concurrent correlation isolation — 20 checkouts fire simultaneously through
   the gateway stream; each request's correlation_id is matched to the correct
   response, and no response leaks into the wrong caller.

4. Pending-message re-delivery after participant crash — the stock service is
   stopped while a checkout is in-flight; after restart the pending Redis
   Stream message is re-delivered (via XREADGROUP id="0") and the saga
   completes successfully.  This is the stream-level equivalent of the old
   Kafka offset persistence test.
